<p><strong>The Nylon Tire Fabric Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire (semi-steel)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nylon tire fabric market finds applications in both bias tires and radial tires (semi-steel). Bias tires are constructed with multiple layers of nylon fabric plies placed at alternating angles, providing flexibility and strength. These tires are commonly used in off-road vehicles and heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, radial tires (semi-steel) use a single layer of nylon fabric called the tire cord, placed perpendicular to the tire tread, enhancing stability and fuel efficiency. Radial tires are widely used in passenger vehicles and provide a smoother and more comfortable ride.</p></p>
