<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small-Scale LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The small-scale LNG market consists of two main types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals are facilities that convert natural gas into its liquefied form, enabling easier storage and transportation. They typically include equipment like compressors and storage tanks. On the other hand, regasification terminals are designed to convert the liquid LNG back into its gaseous form for use in various applications. This process involves heating the LNG to convert it back to its original state. Both types of terminals play a crucial role in the small-scale LNG market, enabling the efficient distribution and use of natural gas.</p></p>
