<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential-Pressure Level Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Level Gauge</li><li>Electronic Level Gauge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The differential-pressure level gauge market is divided into two types: mechanical level gauge and electronic level gauge. Mechanical level gauges use a float, displacer, or glass tube that senses liquid level changes and translates them into a reading on a scale. These gauges are often used in non-hazardous and low-pressure applications. On the other hand, electronic level gauges use sensors and transmitters to measure the pressure difference between the liquid and its vapor phase. They are typically used in high-pressure and hazardous environments where accuracy and reliability are crucial.</p></p>
