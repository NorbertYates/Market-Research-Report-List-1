<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Smart Smoke Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photoelectric</li><li>Dual Sensors</li><li>Ionization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential smart smoke detectors market can be classified into three types: photoelectric, dual sensors, and ionization. Photoelectric smoke detectors use a light source and a sensor to detect smoke particles, making them more effective at detecting smoldering fires. Dual sensors combine both photoelectric and ionization technologies, making them capable of detecting both smoldering and flaming fires. Ionization smoke detectors use a small amount of radioactive material to create an electric current that is disrupted by smoke particles, making them more sensitive to fast-flaming fires.</p></p>
