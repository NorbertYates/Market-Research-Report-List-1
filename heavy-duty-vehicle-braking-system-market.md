<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-duty Vehicle Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty vehicle braking system market is divided into two main types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes consist of a rotating drum that houses brake shoes, which expand when the brakes are applied to create friction and slow down the vehicle. On the other hand, disc brakes use a rotating disc and brake pads to clamp down on the disc, generating friction and stopping the vehicle. Both types of brakes are commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles to ensure effective braking and safety on the road.</p></p>
