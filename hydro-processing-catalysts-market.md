<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro-processing Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrotreating</li><li>Hydrocracking</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydro-processing catalysts market can be divided into two types: hydrotreating and hydrocracking. Hydrotreating is a process that removes impurities like sulfur, nitrogen, and metals from petroleum fractions, improving their quality and reducing environmental pollution. Hydrocracking, on the other hand, involves breaking down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more valuable ones by using hydrogen and a catalyst. Both processes play crucial roles in the refining industry by enhancing fuel quality, increasing yield, and complying with environmental regulations.</p></p>
