<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Process Tapes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Tape</li><li>Non-UV Tape</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor process tapes are used in the manufacturing process of semiconductors to protect delicate electronic components. UV tape, also known as UV-curable tape, is cured by ultraviolet light, providing high adhesion and heat resistance. It is commonly used in wafer dicing and die attach processes. Non-UV tape, on the other hand, does not require UV curing and is suitable for processes that do not involve such high temperatures. Both types of tapes play a crucial role in ensuring efficient and reliable semiconductor production.</p></p>
