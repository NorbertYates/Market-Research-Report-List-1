<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Material</li><li>Non-Absorbable Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial fixation systems are medical devices used in neurosurgery to hold the skull fragments together after a craniotomy. The market for cranial fixation systems can be classified into two types based on the material used: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable cranial fixation systems are made from materials that gradually biodegrade over time, reducing the need for device removal. Non-absorbable cranial fixation systems, on the other hand, are made from materials that remain permanently in the body. The choice between absorbable and non-absorbable systems depends on factors like patient age, bone healing ability, and surgeon preference.</p></p>
