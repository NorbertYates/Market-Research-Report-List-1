<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1,3 Butadiene (BD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extractive Distillation</li><li>Oxidative Dehydrogenation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The 1,3 Butadiene (BD) market is categorized into two types: Extractive Distillation and Oxidative Dehydrogenation. Extractive Distillation involves the separation of butadiene from the other components present in the feed using suitable solvents or distillation columns. On the other hand, Oxidative Dehydrogenation involves the direct conversion of butene to butadiene through a catalytic reaction, which eliminates the need for feed separation. Both methods have their advantages and are employed in the market depending on factors such as cost-effectiveness and environmental impact.</p></p>
