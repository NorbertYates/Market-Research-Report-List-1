<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bispecific Antibody Therapeutic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bearing An Fc Region</li><li>Lacking An Fc Region</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Bispecific Antibody Therapeutic market is divided into two types: those that bear an Fc region and those that lack an Fc region. Antibodies bearing an Fc region contain a fragment crystallizable region, which helps in antibody effector functions such as immune cell activation and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. On the other hand, antibodies lacking an Fc region do not have this region, thus potentially reducing certain side effects associated with Fc-mediated processes. These different types allow for diverse therapeutic options in the treatment of various diseases.</p></p>
