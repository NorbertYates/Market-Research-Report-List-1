<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Freediving Respiratory Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open(Open-Circuit)the Respiratory System</li><li>Enclosed(Closed-Circuit) the Respiratory System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Freediving Respiratory Systems Market includes two main types of systems: Open and Enclosed. Open (Open-Circuit) respiratory systems involve the diver inhaling from the ambient environment and exhaling into the surrounding water. This system is used for shallow dives and requires frequent resurfacing to exhale. In contrast, Enclosed (Closed-Circuit) respiratory systems involve recirculating the diver's breath by removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen. This allows for longer and deeper dives as the system conserves gas, making it suitable for professional and deep freediving.</p></p>
