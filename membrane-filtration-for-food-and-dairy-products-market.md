<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Filtration For Food and Dairy Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reverse Osmosis</li><li>Ultra-filtration</li><li>Nano Filtration</li><li>Micro Filtration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Membrane filtration is a process used in the food and dairy industry to separate impurities and particles from liquids. There are four types of membrane filtration: reverse osmosis, ultra-filtration, nano-filtration, and micro-filtration. Reverse osmosis involves applying pressure to the liquid, forcing it through a semi-permeable membrane to remove small particles and contaminants. Ultra-filtration operates at a higher pore size than reverse osmosis, removing larger particles. Nano-filtration provides a medium level of filtration, removing particles of different sizes. Micro-filtration operates at a lower pore size, effectively removing microbes and larger molecules.</p></p>
