<p><strong>The Millimeter Wave Diabetes Treatment Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type 1 Diabetes</li><li>Type 2 Diabetes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Millimeter wave diabetes treatment devices are used for the management of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, often diagnosed in childhood, requires lifelong insulin therapy and can benefit from mmwave devices for better insulin absorption and glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes, typically developed in adulthood due to lifestyle factors, can utilize these devices to stimulate insulin production, regulate blood sugar levels, and potentially reduce the need for medication. With their non-invasive nature, mmwave devices offer a promising application in improving the treatment outcomes for individuals with diabetes.</p></p>
