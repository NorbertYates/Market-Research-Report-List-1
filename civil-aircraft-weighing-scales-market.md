<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Civil Aircraft Weighing Scales Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Platform</li><li>Floor-standing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The civil aircraft weighing scales market consists of two main types: platform and floor-standing scales. Platform scales are designed for smaller aircraft and are typically portable and compact. They provide accurate weighing measurements and can be easily moved and positioned under the aircraft. On the other hand, floor-standing scales are suitable for larger aircraft and are anchored to the ground. They offer high load-bearing capacity and stability, enabling accurate and reliable weighing of heavy aircraft. Both types of scales play a crucial role in measuring the weight distribution of civil aircraft for safety and performance purposes.</p></p>
