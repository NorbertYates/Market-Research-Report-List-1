<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NPWT Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mains-powered</li><li>Battery-powered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mains-powered NPWT devices are those that are connected to the electrical power source through a cable. These devices require a continuous supply of electricity for their operation and may offer more consistent and powerful suction compared to battery-powered devices. On the other hand, battery-powered NPWT devices do not require a constant power source as they are equipped with rechargeable batteries. These devices offer portability and flexibility, allowing patients to move around while receiving therapy, but may have limitations in terms of suction power and duration.</p></p>
