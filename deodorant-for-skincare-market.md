However, according to industry estimates, Unilever (the parent company of Dove and Axe Dry) reported deodorant sales revenue of approximately $4.2 billion in 2020. Procter & Gamble (parent company of Old Spice) reported sales revenue of approximately $71 billion globally in the same year, although it is unclear what portion of this figure was specifically attributed to deodorant sales.</p><p>Overall, the skincare market is dynamic and competitive, with various players, such as Dove, Old Spice, and others, continuously striving to innovate and meet changing consumer needs.
