<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Dryer Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Heat dryer systems can be broadly categorized into two types: direct type and indirect type. In direct type systems, hot air is directly in contact with the substance to be dried. This method is suitable when rapid drying is required, as it allows for efficient heat transfer. On the other hand, in indirect type systems, hot air is not in direct contact with the substance. Instead, heat is transferred to the substance through a heat exchanger. Indirect type systems are typically preferred when the substance being dried is sensitive to direct heat.</p></p>
