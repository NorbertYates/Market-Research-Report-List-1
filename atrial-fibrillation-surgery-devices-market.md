<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices market includes two main types of procedures: Catheter Ablation and Maze Surgery. Catheter Ablation involves the use of a catheter to deliver radiofrequency energy or cryotherapy to destroy abnormal heart tissue causing irregular heartbeats. This helps restore normal heart rhythm. On the other hand, Maze Surgery is a more invasive procedure that creates scar patterns in the heart to redirect electrical impulses, restoring normal heart rhythm. Both procedures aim to treat Atrial Fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder.</p></p>
