<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Cars and EVs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HEV</li><li>PHEV</li><li>EV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) are cars that combine an internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric motor. They use both gasoline and electricity to power the vehicle, improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) work similarly but have a larger battery that can be recharged by plugging it into an outlet. They can run on electricity alone for shorter distances. Electric Vehicles (EVs) entirely operate on electricity, powered by a rechargeable battery and do not have an ICE. They produce zero emissions and rely solely on charging stations for power.</p></p>
