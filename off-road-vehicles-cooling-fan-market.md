<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Off-road Vehicles Cooling Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Radiator Fan</li><li>Electric Radiator Fan</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The off-road vehicle cooling fan market consists of two main types: mechanical radiator fans and electric radiator fans. Mechanical radiator fans are powered by the engine through a belt drive system, and their rotation helps in cooling the engine by drawing air through the radiator. On the other hand, electric radiator fans are powered by an electric motor, and they operate independently from the engine. They are controlled by a temperature sensor and help maintain optimal engine temperature by drawing air through the radiator when needed.</p></p>
