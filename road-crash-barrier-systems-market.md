<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Crash Barrier Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-rigid Barriers</li><li>Rigid Barriers</li><li>Flexible Barriers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road crash barrier systems are designed to prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway or colliding with obstacles, reducing the severity of accidents. There are three main types of barrier systems: semi-rigid, rigid, and flexible. Semi-rigid barriers, made of steel or concrete, provide moderate impact absorption and minimize vehicle redirection. Rigid barriers, typically made of strong materials like concrete or steel beams, offer high protection but offer minimal impact absorption. Flexible barriers, often constructed of cables or ropes, absorb impacts and redirect vehicles safely whilst minimizing damage to the barrier itself.</p></p>
