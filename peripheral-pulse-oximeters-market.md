<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Pulse Oximeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable Sensor</li><li>Reusable Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral pulse oximeters are medical devices used to measure oxygen saturation levels in the blood. The market for these devices can be divided into two types of sensors â€“ disposable and reusable. Disposable sensors are used once and then discarded, making them cost-effective and hygienic for single-use applications. Reusable sensors, on the other hand, can be used multiple times after proper cleaning and disinfection. Both types serve the same purpose of monitoring oxygen levels, but differ in terms of convenience, cost, and environmental impact.</p></p>
