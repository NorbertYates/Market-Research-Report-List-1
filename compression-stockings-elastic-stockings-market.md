<p><strong>The Compression Stockings (Elastic Stockings) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gradient Socks</li><li>Anti-Embolism Socks</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Compression stockings, also known as elastic stockings, are specialized medical garments designed to improve blood circulation in the legs and prevent various leg-related conditions. There are two main types of compression stockings on the market: gradient socks and anti-embolism socks. Gradient socks apply the maximum compression at the ankle and gradually decrease towards the top, aiding blood flow and reducing swelling. Anti-embolism socks, on the other hand, are specifically meant to prevent blood clots by exerting a consistent level of compression throughout the leg. Both types of stockings are crucial for individuals with circulation issues or those at risk of blood clots.</p></p>
