<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polycarbonate (PC) Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosgene</li><li>Non-Phosgene</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polycarbonate (PC) resin is a type of thermoplastic material used in various industries. It can be produced through two different processes - Phosgene and Non-Phosgene. Phosgene-based PC resin is manufactured using phosgene gas, which is chemically reactive and potentially hazardous. Non-phosgene-based PC resin, on the other hand, is made without the use of phosgene gas, resulting in a safer production process. Both types of PC resin have similar properties and applications; however, the choice between them depends on factors such as safety concerns and environmental regulations.</p></p>
