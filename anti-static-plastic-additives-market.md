<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Plastic Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coating Type</li><li>Internal Additive Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Anti-Static Plastic Additives Market includes two main types: coating type and internal additive type. Coating type additives are applied as a thin layer on the surface of plastic products. They provide temporary static dissipation and can be easily applied during the manufacturing process. On the other hand, internal additive type additives are mixed directly into the plastic material. They provide long-term static dissipation properties and are more effective in reducing static charges in plastic products.</p></p>
